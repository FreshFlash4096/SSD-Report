# SSD-Report
Supplement to my [Blog](https://freshflash4096.github.io/tags/benchmark/) & [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@FreshFlash4096)

All reviews on my blog are based in Korean.   
I tried to use English within images as much as possible to facilitate machine translation.   
English subtitles will also be uploaded to YouTube.   

If you just want to quickly check the final results, it's also a good idea to refer to [this page](https://github.com/FreshFlash4096/SSD-Report/wiki).   
All data from the drives I've tested so far has been included :)
